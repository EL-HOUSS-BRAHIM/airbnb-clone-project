👥 Team Roles
Backend Developer
Designs and builds the core engine of the application — creating API endpoints, implementing business logic, and setting up database schemas. In this project, they ensure smooth communication between the front end and the database, basically making the magic happen behind the curtain.

Database Administrator (DBA)
Architects the heart of the data layer. They design and optimize the database, set up indexing for faster queries, and make sure the data structure can scale. In this project, they ensure data is not just stored, but stored smartly — fast, reliable, and secure.

DevOps Engineer
Bridges the gap between development and operations. They automate deployments, set up CI/CD pipelines, monitor system health, and handle scaling. In this project, they make sure the backend doesn’t just work on a laptop — it works at scale, in production, under real pressure.

QA Engineer
The shield against disaster. They design and run rigorous tests to catch bugs before users ever see them. In this project, they ensure that backend functionalities are reliable, secure, and meet the project's quality standards, so no surprises explode after launch.
